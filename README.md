### Hello, I'm Geoff ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer with a background in filmmaking, specializing in building custom, end-to-end web applications that solve complex business problems.

My passion is partnering with founders and business owners to understand their vision and translate it into well-crafted, maintainable, and scalable software.

**My Current Focus:**

I am currently developing **Project Keystone**, a multi-tenant, HIPAA-compliant platform designed to be the "operating system" for doula agencies. My goal is to empower these vital healthcare providers by streamlining their client management and demystifying the world of insurance billing.
